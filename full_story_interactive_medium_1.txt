I walk to my garden. It is full of life. Flowers and vegetables grow here. The garden has red roses and green beans. I plant seeds in the soil. I water the plants. A garden is a place to grow plants. It is not like a park. We take care of plants here.

Suddenly, I feel wind. The wind sprite appears. It says a hurricane is coming. A hurricane is a big storm. It has strong winds and lots of rain. A hurricane is much more powerful than a windy day. The wind sprite warns us to be ready.

The air gets cold. Ice forms on the plants. Ice is frozen water. It feels hard and cold like a rock. I see the ice-crystal butterfly. Its wings sparkle with ice. The garden starts to look like winter.

The wind sprite uses its magic. It changes the hurricane's cold winds. Now, the winds are gentle and warm. Ice melts from the plants. The garden returns to life. I see colors come back. The garden is bright again.

I learn about hurricanes and ice. Hurricanes are strong storms. Ice forms when it gets very cold. But magic can help. The wind sprite saved the garden. I am happy the garden is safe again.
