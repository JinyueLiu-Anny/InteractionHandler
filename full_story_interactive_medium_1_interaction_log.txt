Ella: Oh, hello Caro! I had such an exciting day! I found a shiny seashell at the beach, and it sparkled like a little treasure! Did you collect or find anything neat today?
Child: um I collect a really beautiful button in my garden today and I really like it
Ella: That's wonderful, Caro! Guess what? My magical rainbow button lets me visit the most amazing places! Let's choose our next adventure together!
Child: A famous landmark on earth (like the Eiffel Tower or Great Wall of China)
Ella: Oh, I’m so excited you chose a famous landmark! The adventures I had exploring those incredible places are unforgettable! Let's get ready with our magic words! To unlock the story, we need to say three special magic words together! Are you ready, Caro?
Ella: Oh no, Caro! It looks like my story is loading the wrong adventure—wait! We need three special magic words to unlock the right story! Are you ready?
Ella: The first magic word is 'garden'. Can you say 'garden'?
Child: Garden
Ella: The second magic word is 'hurricane'. Can you say 'hurricane'?
Child: hurricane
Ella: The third magic word is 'ice'. Can you say 'ice'?
Child: ass
Ella: Oops, I didn't hear that clearly. Could you repeat 'ice'?

Ella: Wow, Caro! You did it! You said all three magic words—"garden," "hurricane," and "ice"—just like a super storyteller!  I'm so proud of you for unlocking the story together! Now we can dive into my amazing adventure! Let’s go!
Ella: Let me tell you what happened on my journey!
Robot:
I walk to my garden. It is full of life. Flowers and vegetables grow here. The garden has red roses and green beans. I plant seeds in the soil. I water the plants. A garden is a place to grow plants. It is not like a park. We take care of plants here.

<interaction>What do you like to do in a garden?</interaction>
Child: um I like to play with my cat in the garden I used to chase her all around in the garden and I also really like the flowers and yes

Robot: That's wonderful! Playing with your cat in the garden must be a fun memory. This garden in our story is also a place full of life, just like when you played with your cat amongst the flowers. Do you think the character in our story would enjoy having a pet to play with in the garden too?
Child:  yes I think so I really like cat I think it's really cute I think um the character in the story would also enjoy to um have a pet
[Scaffolding Strategy: reducing_choices (high support) - Complexity Score: 5.0/10] [Target Vocabulary: garden (easy)]
Robot: That's great! Cats are indeed cute. So, in our garden story, do you think the character should play chase with a pet cat amongst the roses, or relax and watch the cat play in the flower beds?
Child (Follow-up 2): I think the character will play Chase with the pat among the Roses, who doesn't like running in the garden
[Scaffolding Strategy: transition (low support) - Complexity Score: 8/10] [Target Vocabulary: garden (easy)]
Robot: Playing chase with a pet among the roses sounds like such fun! Now let's imagine how our character could prepare the garden for the upcoming hurricane.
Robot:


Suddenly, I feel wind. The wind sprite appears. It says a hurricane is coming. A hurricane is a big storm. It has strong winds and lots of rain. A hurricane is much more powerful than a windy day. The wind sprite warns us to be ready.

<interaction>Can you guess what happens when a hurricane comes?</interaction>
Child: um I don't really know I think it would just be a very very strong wind and, it may destroy my garden and I can't go out to play with my cat in the garden anymore
[Scaffolding Strategy: eliciting (high support) - Complexity Score: 4.0/10] [Target Vocabulary: hurricane (new)]
Robot: You're right! A hurricane can be very strong and might disrupt the garden. Considering that, how do you think we can protect our garden from the hurricane?
Child: um I don't know, maybe don't let the hurricane come to the Garden or build a shield shield or something outside a garden to protect it I don't I really don't know
[Scaffolding Strategy: co-participating (high support) - Complexity Score: 0/10] [Target Vocabulary: hurricane (new)]
Robot: You are thinking well! Building a shield to protect the garden from the hurricane could be a great idea. I wonder what materials we could use to make this shield strong enough to withstand the hurricane. What do you think?
Child (Follow-up 2): what do you mean by what materials, I I don't know what you mean about this question
Ella: That's okay! It just means thinking about what things you need to make or create something fun!
[Scaffolding Strategy: transition (low support) - Complexity Score: 8/10] [Target Vocabulary: hurricane (new)]
Robot: You're showing great thought about protecting the garden! With a shield, we might be able to keep the garden safe from the hurricane. What do you think we could use to create this shield?
Robot:


The air gets cold. Ice forms on the plants. Ice is frozen water. It feels hard and cold like a rock. I see the ice-crystal butterfly. Its wings sparkle with ice. The garden starts to look like winter.

<interaction>What happens to water when it turns into ice?</interaction>
Child: um I think the water will be cold and hard like a rock like what you said and,  I really like I really like ice I think they're really beautiful and also I like to play in the winter and I yeah I like ice
[Scaffolding Strategy: co-participating (high support) - Complexity Score: 5.0/10] [Target Vocabulary: ice (review)]
Robot: You're right, water does become cold and hard like a rock when it turns into ice. I'm thinking about the beautiful ice-crystal butterfly we saw in our garden. I wonder if it feels the same way as the ice we play with in winter. What do you think the butterfly's wings feel like?
Child: I don't know what you mean by what the butterflies means feel like I I think it will be beautiful and also I'm thinking the butterfly wings may be really thin and fragile, you can easily break it so don't break it
[Scaffolding Strategy: reducing_choices (high support) - Complexity Score: 0/10] [Target Vocabulary: ice (review)]
Robot: You're right, the ice-crystal butterfly's wings are delicate and beautiful, just like ice! Do you think the wings are as cold and hard as the ice we play with in winter, or are they more fragile and easy to break?
Child (Follow-up 2):  I think the butterfly wings will be really fragile and easy to break because it's really thin you know, you can you you definitely cannot play it
Ella: You're right, butterfly wings are delicate, but they're also beautifully strong in their own way, just like you can be careful and still enjoy the beauty around
[Scaffolding Strategy: transition (low support) - Complexity Score: 8/10] [Target Vocabulary: ice (review)]
Robot: Your thoughts about the butterfly's wings being thin, fragile, and easy to break are insightful! Now, let's imagine the ice melting away as the wind sprite uses its magic. How do you think the garden changed after the ice melted?
Robot:


The wind sprite uses its magic. It changes the hurricane's cold winds. Now, the winds are gentle and warm. Ice melts from the plants. The garden returns to life. I see colors come back. The garden is bright again.

I learn about hurricanes and ice. Hurricanes are strong storms. Ice forms when it gets very cold. But magic can help. The wind sprite saved the garden. I am happy the garden is safe again.

<interaction>If you could visit the garden, what would you like to see or do there?</interaction>
Child: you mean after the hurricane and the cold weather? uh if it's after that I think I would like to see my flowers I want to see if they're okay and I would also like to feel the Warm Winds and everything

Robot: That sounds wonderful! You mentioned the warm winds, do you remember who was responsible for changing the cold winds of the hurricane into warm ones to save the garden?
Child: I think you said that the magic uh with the magic the Hurricanes can  can pass and the cold winds and water will turn into warming winds and Waters
[Scaffolding Strategy: story_retelling (medium support) - Complexity Score: 4/10] [Special Tag: summary]
Robot: That's right, the magic definitely helped! Can you tell me a little more about how the garden looked before and after the hurricane?
Child (Follow-up 2):  um I think the garden are a beautiful and sunny and I have lots of beautiful flowers and butterflies flying in the garden and that's before the hurricane and after the hurricane um I think you mentioned about ice and cold winds and the butterflies and flowers are covered by ice and yes and with magic the um the garden it's getting warm back again so every beautiful flowers and butterflies are back again
[Scaffolding Strategy: story_retelling (medium support) - Complexity Score: 5/10] [Special Tag: summary]
Robot: You did a great job retelling the story! I'm curious, do you remember who warned us about the approaching hurricane and helped change the cold winds to warm ones?
Child (Follow-up 3): I think it's the wind Sprite but I have no idea what that is
[Scaffolding Strategy: story_retelling (high support) - Complexity Score: 2/10] [Special Tag: summary]
Robot: You're right, it was the wind sprite who used magic to change the cold winds into warm ones. Can you tell me more about the ice-crystal butterfly and what it did during the hurricane?
Child (Follow-up 4): I don't know what you want me to talk to you about I mean I think the ice cradle butterfly will be really beautiful and I would like to see a real 1 and I don't know I mean during the hurricane it's all become really cold and the Butterfly maybe it freezed in the garden and then it it became a ice cradle butterfly
[Scaffolding Strategy: story_retelling (medium support) - Complexity Score: 4/10] [Special Tag: summary]
Robot: That's a good point! The ice-crystal butterfly must have been really beautiful. Can you tell me more about the role of the wind sprite in the story?
Child (Follow-up 5): I don't think it played any role in the story though cuz I don't know what a win's right is and um I think the only thing that wins Sprite did is to warn I don't know we wore Ella that there there's a hurricane coming um other than that I don't know
[Scaffolding Strategy: story_retelling (high support) - Complexity Score: 3/10] [Special Tag: summary]
Robot: You're right, the wind sprite did warn us about the hurricane. Can you remember what happened to the plants in the garden when the hurricane brought the cold winds and ice?
